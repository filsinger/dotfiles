# filsinger's dotfiles

## installation
- `git clone git://github.com/filsinger/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `rake install`

The rake install will symlink any file within the `~/.dotfiles` directory that ends in `.symlink`
into your home directory.

## more information
My dotfile setup is ~~ripped off of~~ based on [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).
Take a look at [his readme](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) for more information (I'm too lazy to type more right now).
